Due to the mnlogit R package being removed from CRAN, and due to needing to change the order of the import statements in the hessian.h file within the mnlogit package to address an import issue in certain environments, we attach a patched version of the mnlogit package directly to this repo with filename "mnlogit_1.2.6.tar.gz". We emphasize that the hessian.h file has been modified from the version built by the original authors (with explicit details on this modification within the file), while the rest of the mnlogit package remains unmodified. The mnlogit_1.2.6.tar.gz file has the following copywright statement:
